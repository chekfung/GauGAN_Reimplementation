    - Change is that we spectral normed everything now in the generator
    - Also change to discriminator where everything spectral normed (referenced in paper)
        - Note: Epoch after this is garbage (we believe due to VGG loss)
    - Looks a lot more like the Pix2PixHD tutorial original outputs which 
      means that we are a lot more hopeful in the future about this.
    - Seems very interesting. Will turn down VGG loss weight for now in the future.

(5/2/20 runs)
On second run, 
    - discriminator rewritten to use spectral norm
    - VGG loss valued at weight: 0.1. We will see how that does then
        - Seems that the discriminator loss is a lot higher than before, which is probably good
    - We will see though.
    - Training rates were back to norm with disc rate = 0.0004, generator rate = 0.0001

    - Uh everything is destroyed. So I am going to revert changes on the discriminator
      to not use spectral norm yet
    
On third run,
    - discriminator back to normal
    - looks kind of bad where everything looks wacky
