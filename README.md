Implementation of the GauGAN Nvidia research paper in Tensorflow rather than Pytorch.

Note: This repository will not contain the ADE20k dataset due to its size. Once we have 
agreed on what the name of the repo will be on each of our computers, it will be set in 
the .gitignore so that we do not have to deal with it.
